portcullis
==========

This is a very simple, minimalistic, responsive theme that I'm using for my personal website. It has some neat features like captioning images, but its best quality is its lack of features (no jQuery, no huge image banners, no post previews, no word counts, etc.).

# Using

```
git clone https://github.com/schollz/portcullis.git themes/portcullis
hugo server -t portcullis
```

# Configuration

You can add your Twitter handle to the configuration file for people can comment you via Direct Messages or Tweets. For example,

```
[params]
    twitter = "yakczar"
```
